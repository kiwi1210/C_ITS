    <h1>Visualizing C-ITS Data from Vehicles — Group Project Report</h1>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Historic datasets of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) and Decentralized Environmental Notification Messages (DENMs) collected from vehicles in Salzburg. CAMs consist of periodic messages that provide GPS coordinates along with dynamic vehicle information, while DENMs are event-driven messages that report special traffic events such as stationary vehicles or traffic jams.</p>

    <h2>Methodology & Workflow</h2>

    <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
    <p>We started by cleaning and parsing the C-ITS datasets, focusing on the CAM and DENM messages—both of which are nested JSON structures with key metadata spread across multiple levels. The goal was to extract only the fields needed for spatial-temporal analysis and visualization. We handled inconsistent or incomplete messages with robust error checks and filtered out irrelevant or redundant fields, such as status flags or confidence indicators that did not add value. Spatial data (latitude, longitude, altitude) was standardized to WGS84 using scaling factors, ensuring compatibility with GIS tools. From CAM messages, we extracted spatial coordinates, timestamps (in UNIX epoch milliseconds), and vehicle dynamics (speed, heading, acceleration, curvature, steering angle). From DENM messages, we pulled out event types, positions, validity periods, traffic relevance, and unique vehicle/station identifiers for grouping and analysis. The cleaned data was stored in a single Pandas DataFrame, where each row represents one message. The DataFrame schema is as follows:</p>

    <h3>Study Area & Data Collection Zones</h3>
    <p>The CAM and DENM messages were collected from vehicles operating across various regions in and around Salzburg, Austria. The figure below shows a side-by-side comparison of CAM (left) and DENM (right) message distributions, overlaid on a satellite map. Each red polygon highlights an area where C-ITS messages were recorded. Purple markers represent individual messages (or clusters thereof), indicating both high-traffic urban centers and more remote, alpine transit corridors. CAMs (left map) show continuous, dense coverage, especially along major roadways, reflecting the periodic nature of these messages. DENMs (right map) appear more sparsely and are concentrated in areas where specific traffic events occurred, such as hazards. These spatial patterns illustrate the complementary nature of CAM and DENM data—while CAMs offer high-frequency motion tracking, DENMs capture rare but important incident-based information.</p>

    <h3>Simple stats</h3>
    <p>The following interactive bar chart summarizes the number of CAM and DENM messages recorded per city. CAM messages, which are sent periodically by vehicles, dominate the total volume. In contrast, DENM messages are event-triggered and occur less frequently, appearing primarily in cities with more complex traffic situations. This distribution provides insight into both baseline traffic flow (via CAMs) and abnormal events (via DENMs).</p>
